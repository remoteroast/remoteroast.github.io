<h4>Where it all began...</h4>

<p>When Osmar and I started working from (not) home together, Corner Coffee was our go to spot. It was near our house, it had a good energy, and most importantly -- it had a parking lot.</p>

<br>

##### What's so good about working from Corner Coffee?

<p>Ironically located one door down from the corner of Hennepin and 28th, Corner Coffee has an ideal working environment that accommodates many working styles. Want to be comfy and chill out while you work? They have couches and warm seasonal drinks. Working with a group? There are long tables with lots of seating. Need privacy for a meeting? There's a room with a sliding door so you can shut yourself in like the antisocial hermit you are. </p>

<p>In addition to all of that, there are not one but <i>TWO</i> bathrooms, strong wifi, and there is always a place to sit.</p>

<p>Osmar and I both have ~sensitive tummies~ which means we can't always drink coffee and sometimes milk translates to loss of integrity as we make our 10th trip to the bathroom in the hour...</p>
##### But whether or not we can have caffeine...

<p>Corner Coffee has great seasonal drinks for coffee lovers and h8rs alike! Personal favorites include the Chaider and the Lavender Lemon Cold Brew. They also have great hot and cold teas, as well as your classic coffee and espresso drinks. And, if you like the smell of coffee, Corner Coffee also roasts beans in house and while the fire alarm did go off one time, usually it just fills the room with the smell of fresh beans (the coffee kind).</p>

<p> If you read the seasonal drinks and rolled your eyes at the concoctions because you're too cool to admit that coffee can taste good with additions other than cream and sugar, here are the simple stats for you bean water aficionados:</p>

<div class="table-responsive" style="font-size:80%">

    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th scope="col">$ Small Drip Coffee</th>
      <th scope="col">Coffee Taste</th>
      <th scope="col">$ Small Latte</th>
      <th scope="col"># Dairy-Free Milks</th>
      <th scope="col">Non Coffee Options</th>
      <th scope="col">Seasonal Drinks</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>$2.75</td>
      <td>5</td>
      <td>$4.75</td>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>Many</td>
      <td>Yes</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
  </table>

<p>Another thing we have come to appreciate at Corner Coffee are the baristas! Everyone made an effort to learn our names, know our drink preferences, and they always say hi. They also frequently will bring food and drinks right to where we're sitting. As a former barista at a fast paced coffee shop named after a reindeer, I know that's not always what you want to do. But I take that as a sign that they like what they're doing and the environment they work in.</p>
<br>

##### Sammies galore!

<p>Sometimes you're so busy that you rush out the door, go-gurt in hand, and when you get to the coffee shop, all you can think about is food. Only me with the go-gurt? That's fine because Corner Coffee has something better.</p>

<p>Open your nostrils folks, because Corner Coffee has delicious breakfast sandwiches made to order and when you smell that bacon, you may just order one yourself. We're also big fans of the BLT. They do have bacon-less options too -- shout out to my Kosher cousins.</p>

##### Oh shit, my computer is about to die!

<p>Have you caught yourself saying that before? Don't fear! An outlet is near! Corner Coffee is very well suited for remote work with outlets along every wall and a chill work environment. The music is usually at a reasonable volume, many of the people inside are also working, and it's easy and comfortable to take a meeting.</p>

<p>That's what we've got for Corner Coffee!</p>
<br>
<p> <i>Pro tip</i>: Are you a big tea drinker but the tea gets cold before you can finish it? You can get the whole pitcher at Corner Coffee and pour it yourself! It stays nice and steamy.</p>
