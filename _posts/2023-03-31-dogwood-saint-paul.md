<h4>Woof woof</h4>

<p>Just kidding. This review isn't about dogs. Tricked ya!</p>

<br>

##### When it's too *ruff* to work from home, get some coffee!

<p>Yes, I am going to make puns. Stop reading now if you hate sophisticated humor. </p>

<p>I had been to Dogwood a number of times before trying it out as a remote work spot. I had brewed their coffee at home and had some college homework sessions at a couple of their locations. But the first time I went to Dogwood's Saint Paul location for remote work was actually because I couldn't find a seat at <a href="https://remoteroast.github.io/quixotic/">Quixotic.</a> That was the first time I went somewhere new to work where I didn't know if I could rely on the wifi. I wished at that time that there was a website where I could see which coffee shops were good for remote work. And now, here we are!</p>
<p>Lucky for me, the wifi was enough for my Zoom call, there was a place to sit, and I could get a good coffee.</p>

##### Is it af*fur*dable? 
<p>Dogwood roasts their own beans. I often buy them for my own brewing at home, so it's no surprise I like their coffee. But for those of you whose red flag is not drinking coffee, there are other drinks like hot teas, tea lattes, and golden milk. I particularly like their chai. Dogwood also has good seasonal drinks and a couple of dairy free options. And while the prices are not the cheapest of the coffee shops we've collected data on, they're not the most expensive either.</p>

##### *Bone* Appetit

<p>When considering all of the great food we've had at coffee shops, I'd say the food at dogwood is fine. I'm not particularly excited by it and there are not many options besides pastries, but what they do have is good. They have a couple of sandwiches but they sell out quickly. The other meal-type option is oatmeal which is just fine.</p>

    <tr>
      <th scope="col">Food Options</th>
      <th scope="col">Food Quality</th>

      <td>Pastries</td>
      <td>3</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

##### *Howl* is the work environment?

<p>As far as the work environment goes, Dogwood has a low key, non-distracting ambiance that is well suited for focusing on work and is great for taking calls. There are booths to silo yourself from the rest of the patrons. Or, if you're feeling social, there are tables that seat larger groups.</p>

<p>If you're easily distracted, Dogwood in Saint Paul may be a good spot for you. The music isn't too loud, there is not typically a big crowd, and there are not many distractions on the walls. There is not a lot of decor and the booths are all wood, so there is a bit of an echo since there isn't much around to absorb sound. Still, the environment is comfortable and it is a good place to get focused work done.</p>

<br>
<p>All in all, Dogwood Coffee in Saint Paul is a solid option. While it's not one of our top choices, that's not because it has any problems. There's a lot we like about it - including that it has a parking lot - but we give it a 3.5. Which, if you're data nerds like us, you'll recognize as being above average.</p>
<br>
<p> <i>Pro tip</i>: Grab a bag of beans! I'm a fan of their light roasts.</p>
