<h4>Dying for caffeine</h4>

<p>I'll be honest and admit that I was originally not enthusiastic about visiting this coffee shop. However, Juliet– being a musician and coffee fanatic– was quite excited. Since she's technically my landlord, I decided to not voice my hesitation and give it a chance. I expected to be met with some heavy metal (yes, some coffee shops do play heavy metal as we learned the hard way), hipster vibes (I'm against most hip things), and satanists (I have nothing to add here but I just realized my love of parentheticals). In the end, I was glad I went because boy was I wrong!</p>

<h5>You had a me at horchata</h5>

<p>Reading the menu, I was immediately drawn to "earl grey horchata latte". So, naturally, I ordered it. The barista then broke my heart by confirming my suspicions: it definitely had dairy in it. I must have had a devastating look on my face because they immediately followed up with: "don't worry, I can make you a dairy-free version with the ingredients I have here". Shoutout to the barista for un-breaking my heart and making me one of my favorite coffee shop drinks EVER (rivaling Corner Coffee's Lavender Lemon Brew). Juliet and I were amazed and (rightfully) obsessed, so much that we worked hard to re-create it at home. (We're so extra so of course we figured it out).</p>

<p>As for the other drinks, they're all pretty good. Disco Death has a variety of fun drinks with fun names like Satan, Hayl Satan, and Prince of Darkness as well as fun prices ($6.66). </p>

<h5>Death by poor posture</h5>

<p>While Disco Death has limited seating, it has never been at more than 50% capacity when we've worked there. It's a chill, lowkey environment which makes it a good place for being productive with minimal distractions. The distractions that do exist, however, are quite worth it. They have a bins along a wall that are filled with records from many, many genres, and Juliet had some fun finds (I myself only recently learned that a turntable is another name for a record player so please don't ask me anything about records). I also love how reliable Disco Death is when it comes to noise level and wifi speed, but I do not love the benches. The benches are at an angle obtuse enough to hurt your back if you have poor posture (like me). It also makes it uncomfortable to lean back all the way while working. But Juliet doesn't seem to mind so maybe it is just a personal issue that I will likely not be resolving (hot take?: I don't believe in chiropractors).</p>

<h5>Dead silence</h5>

<p>Disco Death is a great place to work at. It has plenty of outlets, no distractions, and it's always pretty quiet. Since it is so quiet, I am unsure if I would take a meeting from there, but that's just a personal preference. The baristas are welcoming and thoughtful. I'm not sure if they worship satan, but if they do, I'd definitely sell them my soul for more drinks like the earl grey horchata. </p>

<p>They have decent food options, but we gave them the score we did because there's not a ton of options (and they don't always have the sandwiches).</p>

<p>If you have made it this far, please join me in a moment of silence to pay respect to Juliet's spilled matcha (#31 and counting). But don't worry, the baristas were kind enough to use compressed air to get it out of her laptop. Once again, shoutout to the amazing baristas for our current drink fixation and saving Juliet's not-backed up data. </p>

<p> <i>Pro tip</i>: All the specialty drinks that are featured on the front of the menus are lattes unless otherwise specified. Do <i>not</i> do what I did in forgetting to ask for alternative-dairy milk</p>
