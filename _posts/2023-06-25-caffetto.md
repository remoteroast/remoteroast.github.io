<h5>C is for coffee</h5>

<p>If you're an OG Remote Roast fan, you'll know that Osmar and I have sensitive tummies ðŸ¥º For a while now that has meant
lots of matcha and other teas for me in lieu of coffee. But no longer! I walked into Caffetto and confidently ordered a cappuccino. It turns out, I am better trained than Pavlov's dogs because before I even received the coffee, I found myself asking where the bathroom is. But, more on that later. First, we'll get into the data you've been waiting for...</p>

<h5>A is for amazing prices</h5>

<p>As we know by now, price does not indicate quality. At $2.65, Caffetto has the lowest price for a small coffee of all the places we've tried so far but certainly not the worst coffee. We're giving the coffee a 3/5. It was solidly good coffee, but nothing extra special. They've got all your classic espresso drinks, and other less common finds like thai iced coffee.</p>
<p>If you're not into coffee, Caffetto has a lot of other options. Everything from your typical teas, to quirky sodas. While we didn't see any seasonal drinks, Caffetto has tons of options so there is no shortage of things to try. They also have 3 different non-dairy milk options for our lactose free friends.<p>

<h5>FF for ffun</h5>

<p>It's not every day you go to a coffee shop that has an arcade in the basement. Unless you go to Caffetto every day. While going downstairs to find the bathrooms, I walked into a basement full of old arcade games. If you need a fun little break from whatever you're doing, there are plenty of games to play.</p>

<p>Caffetto also has lots of art for sale. Stickers, pins, ceramics, and wall art are all for sale with QR codes to directly pay the artists. It's good that there's a lot to look at because you may need something to do while you wait for things to load. The wifi is enough to do basic tasks, but there's not enough speed for meetings.</p>

<h5>E is for environment</h5>

<p>You can probably tell from the pinball and paintings that Caffetto is not your typical sterile cafÃ©. It has more of a grunge/artsy feel with mismatched tables, torn upholstery, and dim lighting. That said, it is comfortable and welcoming and it's typically not crowded or noisy. Because it's not too crowded, the number of outlets is sufficient. While they're not at every table, there are plenty to go around.</p>

<h5>TT is for tasty</h5>

<p>Caffetto has a good variety of food options but most of them are pastries. They have varying cakes and cheesecakes as well. We liked the food quite a bit and we give it a 4.</p>

<h5>O is for "Oh my god it's the end of the review!"</h5>
<p>Overall, we are fans of Caffetto. It's probably best for a day with no meetings where you don't have a heavy workload as the wifi is not the best, but the environment is a great mix of fun and comfortable. There's also a decent amount of outdoor seating in the summer.</p>

<p> <i>Pro tip</i>: Hungry? Caffetto's prime uptown location means there's a lot going on nearby! Bebe Zito's is right next door so you can pick up a cheeseburger or an ice cream cone. Or, you can head across the street to the Wedge Co-op if you're looking for healthier options.</p>
