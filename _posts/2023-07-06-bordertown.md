IN PROGRESS

<h5>Borderline Dinkytown</h5>

<p>Bordertown Coffee is located in a beautiful building right outside of Dinkytown on the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities campus. Once an old abandoned house set for demolition, it's since had a long history as a coffeeshop following its purchase and restorationâ€“ still standing even after the 2002 Dinkytown riots. The building's interior matches its alluring exterior. The view of the wide window on the main floor is obstructred by trees but, nonetheless, allows for plenty of natural lighting. On that same floor, there is a (possibly functional?) fireplace under a cute caricature of Bordertown itself. On both sides of the fireplace, there are wall insets for a couple of benches, and there are other types of seating including couches, as well as high and top tables. Overall, it's cozy, sufficiently spacious, and a decent place to enjoy a beverage. </p>

<h5>Borderline Prices</h5>

<p>The prices at Bordertown Coffee are pretty average. Lattes and small drip coffee aren't the cheapest here, but they are also not outrageously expensive as they are in other places. When Juliet and I first visited Bordertown, we were very disappointed with the matcha: it was poorly mixed and we could hardly taste the matcha itself. I was also unimpressed with my chai latte. However, after hearing a few good things about Bordertown, I decided to revisit it and was gladly surprised by how not-terrible it was that time around. I ordered two of their new seasonal drinks that ended up being phenomenal.</p>

<p>Important context: I have an obsession with lemonade. From Cane's to homemade and even (yes, shame on me) Chick-Fil-A. I have a strong preference for that perfect 1:1 sweet-to-sour ratio. And, although this lemonade, being on the sweeter side, did not achieve that it was still pretty amazing and unique to the *many* lemonades I've had in the past. It's also cute, so I will definitely be ordering the berry lavender lemonade again. (aside: it kind of reminded me of that one kid's berry juice now that I think of it).</p>

<p>The second seasonal drink I tried was the matchado: a cortado made with matcha. In addition to the clever, punny name, its strong matcha taste reassured me that I made the right choice. Like the lemonade, it was also kind of cute: </p>

<h5>Something border</h5>

<p>Bordertown's chill environment allowed us to be productive and get a ton of work done. Their seating area is separated from the ordering counter and the entrance, so there are minimal distractions from people coming in and out. They had enough outlets and it's simultaneously not loud nor eerily quiet that it makes it a good place to take a virtual meeting.</p>

<p>The one *really* bad thing about Bordertown is the parking. Although there are quite a bit of parking spots, they are ridiculously expensive. I am talking ...</p>

<h5>Border something</h5>

<p>The food was decent and they do have a range of options from muffins to quiches. However, they also advertise having sandwiches but were out of them the times I was there. Overall, I think its a solid place </p>
