<h2>Spring part 2 plus a little bit of summer!</h2>

<p>It's HOT outside. Want to know the best place for a cold caffeine boost while you work? We'll give you the quick view (The Shots) if you've only got a minute, but keep reading for some insights (Spilling the Beans) on where we went and how we felt about it. Yes, the headers are bad coffee puns.</p>

<h3>Spilling the Beans</h3>

<h4>Spyhouse Nicolet</h4>
<p>We continued our spring journey with <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/spyhouse-nicollet">Spyhouse Nicollet</a>  
  and we didn't have a ton of great things to say... </p>
<ul>
  <li>The wifi is remarkably poor.</li>
  <li>The drinks are some of the most expensive with a latte starting at $6.30.</li>
  <li>We like that they don't upcharge for non-dairy milks, but the cost is built in to the base price of their drinks.</li>
  <li>We also like that they have a lot of outlets.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Disco Death Records</h4>
<p>Our next stop was <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/discodeath">Disco Death</a>. A coffe shop/record store/film lab combo with creative drinks and helpful baristas. We tried all sorts of fun drinks and have come back many times since. Here's why:</p>
<ul>
  <li>While they have limited seating, it's usually not full during the work day meaning you won't be in a crowd if you don't like that. </li>
  <li>They have delicious creative drinks. We liked them so much we tried to re-create them at home!</li>
  <li>While they mostly have pastries, they sometimes have sandwiches as well. Food options are limited, but tasty.</li>
  <li>If you need a break from work, you can flip through some records and spend more money than you planned to!</li>
</ul>

<h4>Caffetto</h4>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/caffetto">Caffetto</a> was on the list for a while before we stopped by. We had a lot of preconceptions about it being not the best place to work. Here's what we decided:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Caffetto has great prices. Some of the lowest we've seen while still producing quality coffee.</li>
  <li>3 non dairy milk options plus tons of non-coffee drinks! There's something for everyone.</li>
  <li>The wifi is pretty slow, but if you're waiting for something to load you can go downstairs where they have a full arcade!</li>
  <li>If you're looking for the anti-Starbucks, you've found it. The biggest drawback is the slow wifi, but there are lots of outlets and plenty of seating.</li>
</ul>

<h4>JS Bean Factory</h4>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/js-bean">JS Bean Factory</a> was one of Juliet's favorites but it took some convincing to get Osmar to go. While he was a skeptic at first, he found some things to like:</p>
<ul>
  <li>They have good quality coffee that they roast in house for a great price!</li>
  <li>The wifi is fast and they have outdoor seating which makes it a great option for sunny days.</li>
  <li>Wile they don't have meals, they do have very good shortbread cookies.</li>
  <li>The biggest detractor was the limited outlets.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Bordertown Coffee</h4>
<p>We heard a lot about <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/bordertown">Bordertown Coffee</a> before our first visit. It's situated in a beautiful old building right on the University of Minnesota campus. We had mixed feelings about the place at first, but came around to it:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The environment is great. It's calm, cozy, and filled with studious college kids.</li>
  <li>The drinks on our first visit were not very good, but upon return, we had some great ones. Mixed results.</li>
  <li>The only parking is paid street parking. If you're planning to spend a morning there, be prepared to fish out an extra $10.</li>
</ul>

<br/>

<p>That's what we've got, folks! Stick around for more reviews and round ups, and check out our new <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/tldr">TL;DR</a> page for a snazzy new map.</p>
