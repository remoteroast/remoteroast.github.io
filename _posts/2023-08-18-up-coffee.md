<h5>Keeping <i><b>Up</b></i> With Our Mission</h5>

<p>Remote Roast gave us a great reason (excuse) to venture off and explore more coffee shops. Some of them have become my safe places, so I have been sticking to those same ones (if you wanna know which ones, check the other reviews) ;) . But we decided enough was enough– our spreadsheet was hungry for more data.</p>

<p>I first visited Up Cafe & Up Coffee Roasters after I went thrifting nearby at Green Threads Vintage (I'd recommend). At first glance I thought it was cute and small– my eyes immediately went to the bold magenta (or primrose, can't quite remember) accent wall. As I peered around the corner, I noticed that there was another room with bigger tables (and another pretty wall!). It's a great place to have a drink and socialize, so I decided to come back and work there with Juliet.</p>

<p>Although there is not an outlet at every table, there are enough scattered around; it's also never super crowded, so we haven't struggled to access one. The wifi is pretty fast (less so outside) and suitable for meetings. It's neither eerily quiet nor distracting.</p>

<h5>Drinks <i><b>Up</b></i> to Our Standards!</h5>

<p>Despite inflation, this coffeeshop has pretty reasonable prices and, more excitingly, several alternative milk options. They also have really fun drinks like thai tea lattes and strawberry shortcake matcha. If you haven't been fortunate enough to try a strawberry milk + matcha combo, this is your sign to change that!</p>

<p>This place does have seasonal drinks (yay!) and I am currently obsessed with the raspberry + rose energy drink. That's right folx: a source of energy without 'em tummy troubles. As the barista put it, "it has caffeine and you'll feel good". And I trust (and tip) my baristas [and you should too (>.>)]. Also, they're super nice and all seem to really like each other. The vibes are <i>splendid</i>.</p>

<h5>You <i><b>Up</b></i> for Some Good Food?</h5>

<p>Ooh, and the food... They have the softest granola bars I've ever had. The caramel on/in them is just delicious (at least I think it's caramel idk). They also have really soft cookies (I recommend the toffee ones). They have some yummy tasting quiches that I cannot vouch for as they all have cheese :( .</p>

<p>Overall, it's a great place for remote work! All the drinks and food we have gotten there so far have been great. They have many seating options, including an outdoor patio (enjoy it while you can!) and some tables along the back of the building. The internet is pretty reliable– but full disclosure, we did struggle with speed and connection strength the time we sat behind the building.</p>

<p> <i>Pro tip</i>: The drinks vary drastically in sweetness, so make sure to ask if you're a sugar hater or addict! Either way, we don't judge (but my mother does :/ ). And if you like really sweet, I recommend the thai tea (don't tell my mom I said that).</p>
