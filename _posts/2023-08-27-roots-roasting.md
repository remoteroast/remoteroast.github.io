<p>We'll start today's review with a recipe. Start by gathering four college students and putting them in a house with <b>one (1) bathroom</b>. Students should possess the following traits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>1 "non-practicing lactose intolerant"</li>
  <li>1 with IBD</li>
  <li>1 whose tummy hurts</li>
  <li>1 man</li>
</ul>

<p>Mix it all up and what do you get? Disaster.</p>
<p>Enter Roots Roasting.</p>

<p>Roots staff of academic year 2019-2020, if you're reading this, thank you and we're sorry.</p>
<p>But, Roots wasn't only our bathroom away from home. It was also a place where we could do homework off campus, get caffeinated, and practice adulting with classic no-frills espresso drinks.</p>
<p>Roots feels classy but hip. It's minimalist aesthetic provides a distraction free work environment where you can do exactly what you're there for and nothing else -- grab a good coffee, sit at a table, and work. </p>
<p>There are fewer outlets than there are seats, but there are a couple at each table. Enough to keep you charged up on your own, but maybe not enough for a group of friends with poor planning and four dead computers. We're giving it a maybe for meetings because it's pretty echoey. As Osmar and I witnessed first hand, conversations at other tables can cause sassy arguments between older boomers and young people laughing loudly.</p>

<p>Roasties (that's you, our devoted fans), Roots Roasting uses their own roasted beans and turns them into classic coffee and espresso drinks. Nothing more, nothing less. And they're great! While they do have non-coffee options, what makes Roots special is their perfectly executed, well priced espresso drinks.</p>

<p>But, it wouldn't be a Remote Roast review without mention of the food. Roots Roasting sells delicious <a href="https://marcheuparis.com/">Marc Heu</a> pastries, but they don't have any substantial meal options. If you're planning to stay the day, there are plenty of restaurants in the area, but you'll have to give up a seat at the table that you may not get back. Roots is small, and can fill up quickly.</p>

<p>If you're looking for a well made espresso drink and minimalist environment, head over to St Paul and give Roots a try. You won't be disappointed.</p>
