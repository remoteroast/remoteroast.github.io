<h2>It's cold. We're sad. Let's reflect on Summer.</h2>

<p>Did you think we'd be consistent in posting every week? That's on us for lying but also on you for believing us.</p>

<h3>Spilling the Beans</h3>

<h4>Up Cafe & Up Coffee Roasters</h4>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/up-coffee">Up Cafe</a>  was the next stop on our coffee journey this summer and we loved it! </p>
<ul>
  <li>Up Cafe has a ton of seating - especially with their outdoor tables in the summer. You'll never be hunting for a spot.</li>
  <li>The wifi works pretty well outside. Maybe not for a meeting, but for other work, you have something to look forward to when it's warm again.</li>
  <li>They lose some points for not having quite enough outlets.</li>
  <li>Lots of options for non-coffee drinkers including energy drinks for those who still want a little boost.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Roots Roasting</h4>
<p>Next, we took a trip to our college neighborhood for some classic expresso drinks at <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/roots-roasting">Roots Roasting</a>.</p>
<ul>
  <li>While small, roots usually has an open seat.</li>
  <li>Roots has a comfortably minimalist environment making it great for concentration.</li>
  <li>There are enough outlets for one per table, but probably not one per person.</li>
  <li>Roots has great pastries from Marc Heu, but no meal options.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Wesley Andrews</h4>
<p><a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/wesley-andrews">Wesley Andrews</a> was on our final stop this summer. Highly requested after visiting with a friend, we made sure to do a review.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Wesley Andrews is weird but in a great way. With seasonal drinks like the Cuban Coffee Soda, you're sure to find something you've never tried before.</li>
  <li>Prices are a little steep here. Not without good reason, the coffee is great and a lot of thought is put into it. But if you're looking to save some money, you probably won't make this a regular spot.</li>
  <li>The wifi can be slow. It's enough to do basic work and low stakes meetings, but I wouldn't count on it for the big things.</li>
  <li>No lunch items here, but there are gluten free pastries. Tried and loved by a gluten free friend.</li>
</ul>

<p>That's what we've got, folks! Stick around for more round ups, and keep an eye on our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/remoteroast/">Instagram</a> for new reviews as we release them!</p>
