<h5>F is for freaking huge</h5>

<p>Okay yeah we’ve been MIA for 9 months. Maybe we were pergnat. That’s really none of your business. What is your business though is the value of Twin Cities coffee shops and today we’re excited to share a favorite we’ve been gatekeeping: FRGMNT at St Anthony Main.</p>


<p>FRGMNT sits in the Riverplace buiding at Main Exposition Hall on St Anthony Main -- a lovely stretch of cobblestone road on the river along Main Street in Northeast Minneapolis. It's almost worth going to just for the view from your car. But while not all seats in FRGMT have a view of the river, you'll definitely find a place to sit. I stopped counting after 40 seats and 20+ tables because I was only half way through the room. I know, lazy, bad data practice, yada yada yada... I'll count it all up some day and update this post.</p>

<p>What I did measure though was the wifi, the bathrooms, and the noise level. And lucky you, they have 4 bathrooms so if you want to shit on my poor data collection there are plenty of spots to do it.</p>

<p>FRGMNT at St Anthony Main feels like someone smushed together a hotel lobby with a hip and kind of yuppie coffee shop. But in a good way? It definitely has a black, wood, brass, and leather aesthetic but the towering atrium brings in a flood of natural light that breaks up the dark. The best part though? It's dog friendly, and I have never been there and not encountered a dog. If that doesn't sound like a good work environment, I don't know what does.</p>
<p>Because it's such a large space, the wifi is definitely stretched to its limits. If you have trouble getting a good connection, try moving around. Also because of its size, there's a lot of open space in the middle where seats do not have outlets. But you know how to read a table. I don't need to spell it out for you.</p>

<h5>RGMNT is for real good, much nice, thanks</h5>

<p>Can you tell by the header I'm rusty with these? Not rusty? The menu at FRGMNT. They've got all sorts of coffee drinks, espresso concoctions, TWO types of iced coffee, AND seasonal drinks. What more could you ask for? I was a big fan of their cranberry tonic last fall which has been swapped out this year for a Mango Calpico Tonic.</p>

<p>For non coffee drinkers, they have an entire menu page of teas and specialty drinks including a matcha tonic with rhubarb bitters and a hojicha latte. Hot and iced options galore at FRGMNT.</p>

<p>This FRGMNT location also offers Cardigan Donuts and Honey + Rye baked goods. I tried the cheddar jalapeño scone and it was pretty tasty. And for those who were wondering, I'd say it was one level above MN spicy. The jalapeños were there but not overpowering.</p>

<p>If you want a big open space in a beautiful setting, try out FRGMNT. You'll see dogs and you won't be disappointed.</p>

<p> <i>Pro tip</i></p>
<p>Unfortunately, parking is $2/hr right outside. Park a few blocks away and enjoy the nice walk and cheaper parking!</p>
