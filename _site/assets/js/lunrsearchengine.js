    "body": "Do you work remotely? Trying to find good coffee shops to work at? You've come to the right place!: In the age of remote work, it can be easy to get stuck in your house. But when we decided to come together and work at local coffee shops, we had to search around for places with good wifi, comfortable work environments, and prices that wouldn't break the bank. We wanted to know which places were good for meetings. Where could we go for fun seasonal drinks when we wanted a little treat? If we were staying for a while, did they have good food? And most importantly, with all the caffeine we were putting in our bodies -- how many bathrooms did they have? So, data nerds that we are, we decided to put all of our findings in one place so you don't have to scour Yelp reviews to see if the wifi is fast enough to load TikTok on your breaks from hard work. Who are we?:  After dropping out of bartending school, Osmar is now a computational neuroscience researcher at the University of Minnesota. His favorite espresso drink is an iced vanilla americano (light ice), and he's also a big fan of iced chai and london fog lattes. When not at a coffee shop, he can be found setting off fires in kitchens. Despite being incredibly chaotic in the kitchen, he does make mean shrimp stew.   After four years as a barista at a Minnesota coffee chain that shall not be named, Juliet is now a Data Analyst at the Star Tribune. Her favorite espresso drink is a hot americano with not too much water, but she also loves a plain old coffee or a fun flavored latte every once in a while. Juliet also plays in Twin Cities band Good Luck Alaska that recently released their debut EP. Buy our next coffee!Thank you for your support! Help us continue to rate coffee shops!

    "body": "2023/07/23 - Bordering DinkytownBordertown Coffee is located in a beautiful building right outside of Dinkytown on the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities campus. Once an old abandoned house set for demolition, it's since had a long history as a coffeeshop following its purchase and restoration– still standing even after the 2002 Dinkytown riots. The building's interior matches its alluring exterior. The view of the wide window on the main floor is obstructred by trees but, nonetheless, allows for plenty of natural lighting. On that same floor, there is a (possibly functional?) fireplace under a cute caricature of Bordertown itself. On both sides of the fireplace, there are wall insets for a couple of benches, and there are other types of seating including couches, as well as high and top tables. Overall, it's cozy, sufficiently spacious, and a decent place to enjoy a beverage.

Lattes and small drip coffee aren't the cheapest here, but they are also not as outrageously expensive compared to other places.         $ Small Drip Coffee   Coffee Taste   $ Small Latte   # Dairy-Free Milks   Non Coffee Options   Seasonal Drinks         $3   4   4. 75   3   Yes   No    When Juliet and I first visited Bordertown, we were quite disappointed with the matcha: it was poorly mixed and we could hardly taste the matcha itself. I was also unimpressed with my chai latte.  However, after hearing a few good things about Bordertown since then, I decided to revisit it and was gladly surprised by how not-terrible it was that time around. I ordered two of their new seasonal drinks that ended up being phenomenal. Important context: I have an obsession with lemonade. From Cane's to homemade and even (yes, shame on me) Chick-Fil-A. I have a strong preference for that perfect 1:1 sweet-to-sour ratio. And, although this lemonade was on the sweeter side and did not achieve that golden ratio, it was still pretty amazing and unique to the many lemonades I've had in the past. It's also cute, so I will definitely be ordering the berry lavender lemonade again. The second seasonal drink I tried was the matchado: a cortado made with matcha. In addition to the clever, punny name, its strong matcha taste reassured me that I made the right choice. Like the lemonade, it was also kind of cute: Mellow-Chill Working BorderBordertown's chill environment allowed us to be productive and get a ton of work done. Their seating area is separated from the ordering counter and the entrance, so there are minimal distractions from people coming in and out. They had enough outlets and it's simultaneously not loud nor eerily quiet that it makes it a good place to take a virtual meeting. The one bad thing about Bordertown is the parking. Although there are quite a bit of parking spots, they are ridiculously expensive. I am talking $2 per hour and $4 when there is an event taking palce at Huntington Bank Stadium. Since most lattes can end up costing nearly $8, you'd be paying double what it's worth with 4 hours of parking (or 2 if you get unlucky).         Outlets   Work Environment   Suitable for Meetings         Some   Chill   Yes    Bordering on HangryThe food was decent and they do have a range of options from muffins to quiches. However, they also advertise having sandwiches but were out of them all of the times I was there. Overall, I think it's a solid place to work from remotely. If I was in the area more often, it would definitely be one of my go-to coffeeshops. Having said that, I doubt I will go out of my way to come here due to the cost of parking. But if parking is not an issue for you, we definitely recommend this place!         Food Options   Food Quality         Mix   3     Pro tip: Definitely ask about their seasonal drinks. They might sound weird, but you'd be surprised! "

    "body": "2023/07/16 - Just SteveThe second half of college was when I really started working at coffee shops. I lived off campus and I finally had a car which meant I could explore more than the few coffee shops within walking distance of the dorms. JS Bean Factory was definitely a favorite. Not only did I like their coffee, but JS Bean Factory is a roastery and I love the smell of roasting coffee beans. When I graduated and started work, I was still living in St Paul and JS Bean Factory was a great covid-friendly place to work. With an abundance of outdoor space and good coffee, what was not to like? Since moving to Minneapolis, the  Bean Factory  as the cool kids call it, has been a bit out of the way. But recently, I was on a mission to pick up a birthday cake in St Paul for a surprise party and took it as an opportunity to stop by. Haters gonna. . . change their minds?When I told Osmar I wanted to meet at JS Bean Factory to work and to hand off the secret birthday cake, his response was  I’m trying to keep an open mind but I’m a lil bit biased bc I dislike this coffeeshop and hate their coffee.   Yes, readers, Osmar was a hater. He said it himself.  As a big fan of JS Bean Factory, I was shocked, hurt, and disturbed by my fellow Remote Roaster's comments. But, as professional big time critics, I decided to let him experience the coffee shop again without my bias interfering in order to preserve our journalistic integrity. Biting my tongue, I replied to Osmar:Osmar made it to the Bean Factory before I did, ordered himself a dirty chai, and my phone buzzed. . . Osmar was officially converted.         $ Small Drip Coffee   Coffee Taste   $ Small Latte   # Dairy-Free Milks   Non Coffee Options   Seasonal Drinks         $2. 10 with 50¢ refills   4   $4. 50   3   Many   Yes    The DeetsOkay, so you know now about the coffee. How about the work environment? The indoor space at JS Bean Factory is small but lively. It's often fairly full with a mix of students, people working, and some people just drinking coffee and chatting. The roasting machines are in full view from the tables, and the walls are lined with quirky signs and art. Make your way outside, and you'll find a whole lot more tables, trees, and sometimes a group of men smoking cigars. It's definitely not a sterile corporate cafe. It's a neighborhood coffee shop, and it feels that way in the best way possible.

Outlets   Work Environment   Suitable for Meetings         Some   Chill   Maybe    Just ShortbreadOkay, they don't just have shortbread, but it might be my favorite thing they have. JS Bean Factory has a mix of good pastries but unfortunately, they don't seem to have more substantial meals. What they do have, is one of the best shortbread cookies I've had, and if I had to, I could eat enough of them for it to equate to a full meal.         Food Options   Food Quality         Pastries   4    So, if you were a skeptic/hater like Osmar, maybe it's time to reconsider. We're giving JS Bean Factory a 3. 5. If I were rating it as just a coffee shop, it may rank higher, but because they don't have tons of outlets and it can often be crowded inside, it loses a few points on the remote work side. That said, I'll definitely be going back and I love buying their beans to brew at home.  Pro tip: You'll often catch Juliet's friend and band-mate Ryan playing music outside on Fridays from 12-2!  "

But no longer! I walked into Caffetto and confidently ordered a cappuccino. It turns out, I am better trained than Pavlov's dogs because before I even received the coffee, I found myself asking where the bathroom is. But, more on that later. First, we'll get into the data you've been waiting for. . . A is for amazing pricesAs we know by now, price does not indicate quality. At $2. 65, Caffetto has the lowest price for a small coffee of all the places we've tried so far but certainly not the worst coffee. We're giving the coffee a 3/5. It was solidly good coffee, but nothing extra special. They've got all your classic espresso drinks, and other less common finds like thai iced coffee. If you're not into coffee, Caffetto has a lot of other options. Everything from your typical teas, to quirky sodas. While we didn't see any seasonal drinks, Caffetto has tons of options so there is no shortage of things to try. They also have 3 different non-dairy milk options for our lactose free friends.         $ Small Drip Coffee   Coffee Taste   $ Small Latte   # Dairy-Free Milks   Non Coffee Options   Seasonal Drinks         $2. 65   3   $3. 95   3   Many   No    FF for ffunIt's not every day you go to a coffee shop that has an arcade in the basement. Unless you go to Caffetto every day. While going downstairs to find the bathrooms, I walked into a basement full of old arcade games. If you need a fun little break from whatever you're doing, there are plenty of games to play. Caffetto also has lots of art for sale. Stickers, pins, ceramics, and wall art are all for sale with QR codes to directly pay the artists. It's good that there's a lot to look at because you may need something to do while you wait for things to load. The wifi is enough to do basic tasks, but there's not enough speed for meetings.

It has more of a grunge/artsy feel with mismatched tables, torn upholstery, and dim lighting. That said, it is comfortable and welcoming and it's typically not crowded or noisy. Because it's not too crowded, the number of outlets is sufficient. While they're not at every table, there are plenty to go around.

It's probably best for a day with no meetings where you don't have a heavy workload as the wifi is not the best, but the environment is a great mix of fun and comfortable. There's also a decent amount of outdoor seating in the summer.  Pro tip: Hungry? Caffetto's prime uptown location means there's a lot going on nearby! Bebe Zito's is right next door so you can pick up a cheeseburger or an ice cream cone. Or, you can head across the street to the Wedge Co-op if you're looking for healthier options.  "

    "body": "2023/06/12 - Dying for caffeine: I'll be honest and admit that I was originally not enthusiastic about visiting this coffee shop. However, Juliet– being a musician and coffee fanatic– was quite excited. Since she's technically my landlord, I decided to not voice my hesitation and give it a chance. I expected to be met with some heavy metal (yes, some coffee shops do play heavy metal as we learned the hard way), hipster vibes (I'm against most hip things), and satanists (I have nothing to add here but I just realized my love of parentheticals). In the end, I was glad I went because boy was I wrong! You had a me at horchata Reading the menu, I was immediately drawn to  earl grey horchata latte . So, naturally, I ordered it. The barista then broke my heart by confirming my suspicions: it definitely had dairy in it. I must have had a devastating look on my face because they immediately followed up with:  don't worry, I can make you a dairy-free version with the ingredients I have here . Shoutout to the barista for un-breaking my heart and making me one of my favorite coffee shop drinks EVER (rivaling Corner Coffee's Lavender Lemon Brew). Juliet and I were amazed and (rightfully) obsessed, so much that we worked hard to re-create it at home. (We're so extra so of course we figured it out). As for the other drinks, they're all pretty good. Disco Death has a variety of fun drinks with fun names like Satan, Hayl Satan, and Prince of Darkness as well as fun prices ($6. 66).          $ Small Drip Coffee   Coffee Taste   $ Small Latte   # Dairy-Free Milks   Non Coffee Options   Seasonal Drinks         $5   4   $4. 5   2   Many   No     Death by poor postureWhile Disco Death has limited seating, it has never been at more than 50% capacity when we've worked there. It's a chill, lowkey environment which makes it a good place for being productive with minimal distractions. The distractions that do exist, however, are quite worth it. They have a bins along a wall that are filled with records from many, many genres, and Juliet had some fun finds (I myself only recently learned that a turntable is another name for a record player so please don't ask me anything about records). I also love how reliable Disco Death is when it comes to noise level and wifi speed, but I do not love the benches. The benches are at an angle obtuse enough to hurt your back if you have poor posture (like me). It also makes it uncomfortable to lean back all the way while working. But Juliet doesn't seem to mind so maybe it is just a personal issue that I will likely not be resolving (hot take?: I don't believe in chiropractors).

It has plenty of outlets, no distractions, and it's always pretty quiet. Since it is so quiet, I am unsure if I would take a meeting from there, but that's just a personal preference. The baristas are welcoming and thoughtful. I'm not sure if they worship satan, but if they do, I'd definitely sell them my soul for more drinks like the earl grey horchata.

Once again, shoutout to the amazing baristas for our current drink fixation and saving Juliet's not-backed up data.   Pro tip: All the specialty drinks that are featured on the front of the menus are lattes unless otherwise specified. Do not do what I did in forgetting to ask for alternative-dairy milk "

    "title": "Spyhouse - Nicollet",
    "body": "2023/05/21 - A little history, a little review, and a little opinion. . . : Spyhouse was in the news back in 2020 when workers were striking due to inadequate COVID protection measures. Baristas were announcing intentions to unionize, management started firing employees, and thus began the strike at all six Spyhouse locations. I had just quit my barista job a few months earlier. I was/am immunocompromised, so much was still unknown about COVID, and much like toilet paper, masks and sanitizer were hard to come by. I had a lot of sympathy for the Spyhouse baristas who were putting their own health in danger and not getting the support they felt they needed from their higher ups. Spyhouse workers eventually voted against unionization and many ended up quitting as a result. Spyhouse management started paying hazard pay soon after the vote - one of the asks of employees who wanted to unionize - but many of the asks that prompted the strike were not fulfilled. All this to say, I likely hold some bias against Spyhouse as an institution. But that's not what I am reviewing here. These are my thoughts on Spyhouse as a place to do remote work - not barista work. And that's the great thing about quantitative data. It doesn't care about my feelings. Enough about my snowflake emotions. You're here for the review. I'll get right to it: Spyhouse on Nicollet is not my favorite place to work. When I first moved to Whittier and was looking for new coffee shops to work at, Spyhouse was one of my first tries. I had stopped by their St Paul location a few times in college but every location has its own quirks and I hadn't been to the Nicollet location before. When you walk in, it seems like a fine place to do work. It's big, there's a lot of seating, and a lot of places to plug in. It's not too loud and you can have your own space or work with friends. That changes when you open your laptop. The wifi is not only slow, but unreliable. At times it would go out completely, but when it was working it hovered around only 20mbps. For context, Comcast does not sell home wifi plans slower than 75mbps. If you're regularly using the internet for your work, this probably won't cut it.         Wifi Speed (mbps)   Noise Level (dB)   # Tables   # Seats   % Crowded   # Bathrooms         21 (but sometimes as low as 5)   91   16   64   70%   1    But at least you will have power!One thing we do like about Spyhouse Nicollet is there are a lot of outlets. You don't have to worry about running out of battery as you run out of patience with the internet. The environment is also pretty mellow. Some of the Spyhouse locations we've been to have not had that low key environment, but Spyhouse Nicollet is comfortable to work at. However, despite these positives, we would not recommend meetings here as the wifi just is not reliable enough.         Outlets   Work Environment   Suitable for Meetings         Many   Mellow   No    Enough about my laptop! What about my need for speed (caffeine)?In an earlier section I said your opinion of Spyhouse might be affected when you open your laptop, but really our first turn off was when we opened our wallets. While Spyhouse does not charge extra for alternative milks, their base prices are high. Kind of like when TVs are 50% off on Black Friday but the price was raised 70% the day before. Spyhouse is the most expensive coffee shop we've reviewed so far with a small latte coming in at $6. 30 and a small coffee at $3. 50. The taste of the coffee is fine - not bad but nothing to write home about. We are fans of their seasonal drinks and they have many dairy free and non-coffee options, but it was difficult for us to overlook the prices. If you're a vanilla latte girlie, be prepared to shell out close to $10 for a small.         $ Small Drip Coffee   Coffee Taste   $ Small Latte   # Dairy-Free Milks   Non Coffee Options   Seasonal Drinks         $3. 50   3   $6. 30   3   Many   Yes    We had similar thoughts on the food. Spyhouse has fairly good pastries. We give them a 3/5. We wish they had more food options, but the options they do have are pretty good. We especially like the pastries from Patisserie 46.         Food Options   Food Quality         Pastries   3    So there you have it. Our short and (not so) sweet Spyhouse review. We probably won't be working there much, so if you don't want to be graced with our presence Spyhouse Nicollet is a great choice! Pro tip: Get the most bang for your buck and get those non-dairy milks with no upcharge!  "

Quixotic was the coffee shop where Juliet first started working regularly after having frequented it in college.  It's comfortable, great for meetings, and they have a lot of tasty food options. Here's what we like most:  Lots of booths! You can have your own personal space while still experiencing the vibrant coffee shop environment.  Osmar's favorite blueberry muffin can be found here (if he hasn't eaten them all).  Quixotic now has great smoothie and yogurt bowls.  It's easy to find parking. SK Coffee - Whittier: When SK Coffee - Whittier opened up just a few blocks away from our house, we knew we'd have to check it out. Someone had to do the community the service of quality checking the new coffee spot and we selflessly volunteered to try their drinks and food. Here's what we thought about it:  We're big fans of the matcha lattes at SK.  The food is top notch! They have a great lentil curry pastry that Juliet would like to eat daily.  Taking meetings at SK can be hit or miss. The music is usually at a decent level but sometimes is less suitable as the background to your Zoom call.  SK only has 21 seats so it's often close to full. Get there early to make sure you can sit! It's worth it. Corner Coffee - Uptown: Corner Coffee was one of the first places that we regularly worked at after moving to Uptown. There's always a place to sit, the environment is laid back but still vibrant, and the baristas will get to know you if you show up often. Some key points:  Corner Coffee always has reliable wifi and lots of outlets making it great for meetings.  The breakfast and lunch sandwiches are great and are made to order.  Get it while you can! The seasonal drinks are always a hit. We LOVE the Lavender Lemon Brew.  If you need non-coffee options, Corner Coffee has got you covered with a variety of teas and other drinks. Dogwood Coffee - St Paul: While Dogwood Coffee - St Paul was not one of our favorite remote work spots, it still earned itself a 3. 5 star rating. Although we like their coffee, the food options are lacking and the environment is somewhat uninspiring. I'm running out of ways to introduce lists:  Dogwood has great coffee. If you like to brew at home, it's worth picking up a bag of beans.  While the food they have is good, there are very few options and their sandwiches sell out quickly leaving not many options for a meal.  If you're looking for a non-distracting environment, Dogwood is a great choice! There is pretty solid wifi and there has always been ample seating available when we have gone to Dogwood. Nina's Coffee Cafe: We love Nina's Coffee Cafe. But maybe not for remote work. It's a fun spot with great drinks, however, it may be too distracting and there aren't many outlets. You can decide for yourself based on our quick notes:  The ambiance at Nina's is great! While it may not be the best for work, it's a great social spot.  The food is pretty good but we've had better pastries elsewhere. Not bad, just not the best.  Lots of dairy free milks at Nina's but beware - the drinks with caramel made Osmar's tummy hurt.  Because it's such a fun spot with great drinks, it's often fairly crowded which makes it a bit ofa riskier option. That's what we've got, folks!

    "title": "Nina's Coffee Cafe",
    "body": "2023/04/27 - Time for a history lesson folx: Bonus points if y'all catch the theme of the section headings. Rumours: Who is Nina?Nina's cafe coffeeshop is named after the founder Nina Clifford– whose real name is Hannah Steinbrecher. Born in Canada, Nina arrived in St. Paul in 1885, and her options of making a living wage were limited as a widow. But folx, that did not hold her back. She established a cafe and bought two other buildings– which no longer stand today– in the red light district of St. Paul. Nina's cafe was rumoured to be a brothel back in the day, but it was actually at those other locations where she ran that business. Of course, gossip doesn't stop there. Some of you may have even heard of those tunnels that supposedly run under Nina's cafe. Well, sadly these tunnels do not actually exist (or so they say). Finally, the last thing I'll clear up is that yes, it is indeed pronounced NINE-uhs and not KNEE-nahs. RIP to all of you that corrected me over the past few years.  Mystery to me: Where the heck is the bathroom?Nina's cafe is in a beautiful building that is only more breathtaking on the inside. The high ceilings and abundant natural light always puts me in a good mood. There is also plenty of seating and it's quite diverse: from couches to nooks and tables. That being said, it is a popular place and it does tend to be crowded. Regarding the bathrooms, there is only one, but it has been out of order the past few times. But no need to fear my fellow sensitive tummy folx as there are two backup bathrooms in Blair's Arcade– the building connected to Nina's. The only issue is. . . finding them can be a bit of a hassle, but Juliet and I have done it and are here to do the work so that you don't have to! Directions to Narnia: alright, you're going to want to step outside the side door into the main hallway and take a right (if you take a left, you will be exiting the building, so uh don't do that). Walk down that mirror hallway past the hair salon and the fountains. Once you step foot on the carpet, you're going to want to go just a bit further until you see the first hallway to the left. Turn left into it and then left again at the end. There, you will see two doors with the lockpads and all that's left to do is punch it in and lock the door behind you!

Mirage: Are you actually working?Although Nina's Cafe is a really nice spot to be in and fulfill your desire for a coffeshop work aesthetic, it may not be the best place if you really need to focus. If you're like me and are easily distracted, you are better off bringing some noise cancellation headphones and doing work that does not require all of your attention. It is usually pretty full, so there is always quite a bit going on. I would not take a meeting here nor would I come here if I had a lot of reading to get done. Nina's cafe is still a great place to have a fun drink and catch up with a friend. They also have a free parking lot nearby!

They have a few seasonal drinks that are always fun and I would definitely recommend. They also have a few dairy-free milks and we love having options. Here is some coffee data:         $ Small Drip Coffee   Coffee Taste   $ Small Latte   # Dairy-Free Milks   Non Coffee Options   Seasonal Drinks         $3. 00   4   $4. 50   4   Many   Yes     While the food at Nina's isn't terrible, it was not my favorite. I've only tried three different pastries and was not in love with any of them nor would I have them again. They also have a breakfast burrito and quiche that I may be trying sometime in the near future, because I will definitely be coming back to Nina's.         Food Options   Food Quality         Many   3     Pro tip: some drinks made with caramel have quite a bit of dairy in them. Even with a dairy-free milk, I would caution my lactose-unfriendly peeps to stay clear of them no matter how good they are :( "

Stop reading now if you hate sophisticated humor.  I had been to Dogwood a number of times before trying it out as a remote work spot. I had brewed their coffee at home and had some college homework sessions at a couple of their locations. But the first time I went to Dogwood's Saint Paul location for remote work was actually because I couldn't find a seat at Quixotic. That was the first time I went somewhere new to work where I didn't know if I could rely on the wifi. I wished at that time that there was a website where I could see which coffee shops were good for remote work. And now, here we are! Lucky for me, the wifi was enough for my Zoom call, there was a place to sit, and I could get a good coffee.

I often buy them for my own brewing at home, so it's no surprise I like their coffee. But for those of you whose red flag is not drinking coffee, there are other drinks like hot teas, tea lattes, and golden milk. I particularly like their chai. Dogwood also has good seasonal drinks and a couple of dairy free options.

I'm not particularly excited by it and there are not many options besides pastries, but what they do have is good. They have a couple of sandwiches but they sell out quickly. The other meal-type option is oatmeal which is just fine.

There are booths to silo yourself from the rest of the patrons. Or, if you're feeling social, there are tables that seat larger groups. If you're easily distracted, Dogwood in Saint Paul may be a good spot for you. The music isn't too loud, there is not typically a big crowd, and there are not many distractions on the walls. There is not a lot of decor and the booths are all wood, so there is a bit of an echo since there isn't much around to absorb sound. Still, the environment is comfortable and it is a good place to get focused work done.         Outlets   Work Environment   Suitable for Meetings         Many   Mellow   Yes     All in all, Dogwood Coffee in Saint Paul is a solid option. While it's not one of our top choices, that's not because it has any problems. There's a lot we like about it - including that it has a parking lot - but we give it a 3. 5. Which, if you're data nerds like us, you'll recognize as being above average.  Pro tip: Grab a bag of beans! I'm a fan of their light roasts. "

    "body": "2023/03/21 - Where it all began. . . : When Osmar and I started working from (not) home together, Corner Coffee was our go to spot. It was near our house, it had a good energy, and most importantly -- it had a parking lot.  What’s so good about working from Corner Coffee?Ironically located one door down from the corner of Hennepin and 28th, Corner Coffee has an ideal working environment that accommodates many working styles. Want to be comfy and chill out while you work? They have couches and warm seasonal drinks. Working with a group? There are long tables with lots of seating. Need privacy for a meeting? There's a room with a sliding door so you can shut yourself in like the antisocial hermit you are.

But whether or not we can have caffeine…Corner Coffee has great seasonal drinks for coffee lovers and h8rs alike! Personal favorites include the Chaider and the Lavender Lemon Cold Brew. They also have great hot and cold teas, as well as your classic coffee and espresso drinks. And, if you like the smell of coffee, Corner Coffee also roasts beans in house and while the fire alarm did go off one time, usually it just fills the room with the smell of fresh beans (the coffee kind).

Everyone made an effort to learn our names, know our drink preferences, and they always say hi. They also frequently will bring food and drinks right to where we're sitting. As a former barista at a fast paced coffee shop named after a reindeer, I know that's not always what you want to do. But I take that as a sign that they like what they're doing and the environment they work in.  Sammies galore!Sometimes you're so busy that you rush out the door, go-gurt in hand, and when you get to the coffee shop, all you can think about is food. Only me with the go-gurt? That's fine because Corner Coffee has something better. Open your nostrils folks, because Corner Coffee has delicious breakfast sandwiches made to order and when you smell that bacon, you may just order one yourself. We're also big fans of the BLT.

Let’s set the stageLocated on Lyndale where Misfit Coffee once stood, this coffee shop’s atmosphere is welcoming to both hipsters and young professionals alike without that hint of snobbiness. I love the pops of color against the white and the wall of plants. The high ceilings and wall-length windows makes it a very bright, open space.

Since then, we have become regulars at the expense of our budgets, and here’s a few reasons why: A matcha made in heaven (I rolled my eyes too)During yet another short-lived phase of swearing off coffee, I started buying matcha at any place I could get my hands on it. I can say without a doubt that my favorite place to get it is– you guessed it– SK Coffee. I typically order the classic vanilla oatmilk matcha latte (yes, unapologetically dairy-free… most times … sometimes. . if you know, you know). I didn’t realize until a few matchas in that it had galium and not vanilla. Through that conversation I learned about their partnership with  3Leche . 3Leche are a group of three mixologists and bartenders that specialize in fermentation and have been expanding to non-alcoholic beverages such as coffee. SK coffee also carries their dolce de leche syrup, which I have not tried yet.  And yes, since this is a coffee blog, I guess I should talk about coffee.

As a chaotic person who’s always on the go and frequently forgets to feed himself, I have had a few occasions where I asked the staff to list out their pastries (sorry for being that person). They are very nice about it and make the ordering anxiety bearable. Oh! The food! It definitely deserves its own mini heading: Pecans, lentils, and cheeseI know, you’re probably like what the heck but don’t worry those ingredients can all be found in separate pastries. But wow their pecan bear claw is truly divine. The only thing more splendid than that– if you’re in a ~savory~ mood– is their lentils pastry. Trust me, as a kid who was forced to eat lentil soup and still has nightmares about it, the lentils in this hot-pocket-like pastry (idk, I don’t bake, but I’m sure Juliet knows what it’s called so you could ask via comments) are WORTH it. I haven’t had one of their cheese croissants because I’m trying to be better about being dairy-free. However, my fellow lactose-intolerant folx know that will not last long especially with the quality of these pastries. (Wow, I’m really hungry right now and realizing I forgot to eat dinner).

The staff is allowed to play their own tunes, and while I personally am an occasional fan of screamo/light metal, it was funny to see Juliet taking a meeting with that as background music. I should point out this has only happened once!Overall, local coffee shop, good vibes. Will definitely keep working from here and might venture to their St. Paul location which I only recently found out about. Stable wifi and good drinks. Juliet and I both give it a 4/5 and would definitely recommend it!  Pro tip: SK is also a roastery!

Quixotic was the first place I went. I was truly a modern woman as I traveled all the way from Minneapolis to St Paul, finally exercising the vast freedom of movement I had as a remote worker. I finally understood  van life  and the  digital nomad  mentality. I mean, I was working from a completely different city! Okay, that might be a stretch. It was Saint Paul, not Costa Rica. But still, there was a sense of excitement and freedom working from neither an office, nor my desk at home. Quixotic was the start to my  work from anywhere  journey and what a great place it was to start with. All that said, you're not here for my trip down memory lane. You're here for the data, right? So onto the (bean) juicy stuffI'll start with our basic quantitative metrics:         Wifi Speed (mbps)   Noise Level (dB)   # Tables   # Seats   % Crowded   # Bathrooms         120   78   27   48   50-80%   1    I chose Quixotic to launch my coffee-shop-remote-woman-in-STEM (god that's obnoxious) adventure because it felt comfortable and familiar. I had done homework there as a college student and what I loved - and still love - most about it is that there are several booths with tall wooden walls between them. You can be in your own personal work area while still participating in the vibrant energy of a neighborhood coffee shop. Not only that, but each table has an outlet and the wifi is reliable, so you can take Zoom calls without worrying about a dying battery or losing connection.  In addition to the booths, there is a larger closed off conference room that can be reserved if you want to work with friends or co-workers. They also have bar seating and regular tables if all of the booths are taken.  But enough about tables. I know you want to hear about the coffee…        $ Small Drip Coffee   Coffee Taste   $ Small Latte   # Dairy-Free Milks   Non Coffee Options   Seasonal Drinks         $2. 75   4   $4. 75   3   Many   Yes    If you just finished a stressful meeting with the boss man or you just got a raise and you deserve a little reward, Quixotic has fun and tasty seasonal drinks that you'll end up spending all of your money on every day for several weeks until you feel bad about it but still can't stop. . . Lucky for you, they also have really good drip coffee at a very reasonable price! If coffee's not your thing, there is a variety of teas, kombuchas, tea lattes, smoothies, and juices to choose from. Personally, I am a fan of their matcha as well as the Jinx teas they offer.  Onto the food…        Food Options   Food Quality         Many   4    If you're anything like me, having coffee on an empty stomach will send you racing to the bathroom. And one bathroom in a coffee shop with 48 seats (yes, we counted) can be a big risk. But at Quixotic, you can find a variety of fresh pastries from Patisserie 46 and Sift (gluten free!), and more recently they've added smoothie and yogurt bowls from Bom Dia Treats.  Finally onto the “work metrics” that are mostly biased and completely subjective…        Outlets   Work Environment   Suitable for Meetings         Many   Chill   Yes    The work environment at Quixotic is fantastic. Most of the people there are working on something, whether it's school work or  work work  - whatever that means. For someone trying to dip their toes into the coffee shop work life, Quixotic is a great place to test out, especially if you can sit in a booth. Can you tell I love the booths? The music is usually at a comfortable volume, people are generally respectful of their noise levels, and the food and coffee are reliably good. You don't have to worry about your wifi cutting out or the background noise being so loud your co-workers can't hear you in a meeting, and they don't unexpectedly start playing niche hard-core bands (more on that in another review). All in all, Quixotic is a great place for a remote worker. Osmar gives it a 4. 5/5, but I give it a 5/5 and this is my review so what I say goes. Pro tip: If you can’t find street parking, pull into the alley just north of the shop. There’s 2 hour parking along one side. But leave a spot for us! "

But when we decided to come together and work at local coffee shops, we had to search around for places with good wifi, comfortable work environments, and prices that wouldn't break the bank. We wanted to know which places were good for meetings. Where could we go for fun seasonal drinks when we wanted a little treat? If we were staying for a while, did they have good food? And most importantly, with all the caffeine we were putting in our bodies -- how many bathrooms did they have? So, data nerds that we are, we decided to put all of our findings in one place so you don't have to scour Yelp reviews to see if the wifi is fast enough to load TikTok on your breaks from hard work. Who are we?:  After dropping out of bartending school, Osmar is now a computational neuroscience researcher at the University of Minnesota. His favorite espresso drink is an iced vanilla americano (light ice), and he's also a big fan of iced chai and london fog lattes. When not at a coffee shop, he can be found setting off fires in kitchens. Despite being incredibly chaotic in the kitchen, he does make mean shrimp stew.     After four years as a barista at a Minnesota coffee chain that shall not be named, Juliet is now a Data Analyst at the Star Tribune. Her favorite espresso drink is a hot americano with not too much water, but she also loves a plain old coffee or a fun flavored latte every once in a while. Juliet also plays in Twin Cities band Good Luck Alaska that is working on their debut EP.  So how are we doing this thing?: Like any good scientists, we have a rigorous methodology… kind ofMost food critics keep their identities hidden. They return to a restaurant multiple times to taste everything on the menu. They get a well rounded view of the different menu items, the atmosphere and service, all while remaining anonymous so that the service they receive is not skewed. Unfortunately for us (and for you), we can’t afford every menu item. But on the plus side, we’re a couple of nobody Zillennials, so we fly by under the radar unrecognizable to baristas worldwide. But onto the good stuff…We’ll be measuring and collecting a variety of data points about each coffee shop – some objective, some not – and sharing them with you. Here’s a look at some of our quantitative data (that’s nerd speak for numbers).         Wifi Speed (mbps)   Noise Level (dB)   # Tables   # Seats   % Crowded   # Bathrooms         410   83. 5   6   21   30%   1    We’ll accompany that data with illustrative descriptions like: The millennial pink bathroom has all the amenities a girl could dream of. Nobody judged us for going in and out every 20 minutes. Next, we’ll get more into the coffee, sharing both quantitative (you know what that means now) with qualitative (read: words/categories) data points:         $ Small Drip Coffee   Coffee Taste   $ Small Latte   # Dairy-Free Milks   Non Coffee Options   Seasonal Drinks         $3. 50   5   $4. 50   2   Few   Yes    These too will have pretentious descriptions like: Juliet sipped on an espresso tonic with flavor notes of stone fruit and bullshit. Osmar opted for a matcha latte and questioned whether the milk was dairy or his preferred alternative until the last drop hit his colon. Then the food…        Food Options   Food Quality         Many   4     And the “work metrics”…        Outlets   Work Environment   Suitable for Meetings         Many   Chill   Maybe     You get the point. We aim to review a new coffee shop every week and let you know what we think. Key word there is “aim”. We’re not perfect, but we’ll let you know which coffee shops are. "
